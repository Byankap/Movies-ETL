Created an automated pipline to extract, clean dataframes, and into load to PostgreSQL database. 
The assignment was to create a ETL function to first read three data sets (Kaggle data file,  wiki file, and ratings file. Then, extract and clean the wiki and kaggle file, such as dropping redundant columns, changing date formats, etc. Merge the three table sets into two data frames. Finally create an engine and a  connection to connect the dataframes to a SQL database.
